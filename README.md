# PAYW Pro
An open source font family for PAYW softwares and graphics based on Inter created by RSMS and Noto Sans KR distributed by Google and [modified](https://github.com/jhaemin/noto-sans-kr) by Jang Haemin. Its Latin and Hangul sans-serif glyphs harmonize each other so well giving the feelings of trustiness and robustness.
